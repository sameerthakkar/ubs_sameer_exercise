We have a table 
	EVENTS(EventId number, EventName VARCHAR2(20), EventTime Timestamp). 
The table contains a list of events which happened earlier. 
An event could happened multiple times so the table will contain records like
EventID     EventName   EventTime
5           EventA      07/19/2017 23:00:00
4           EventB      07/19/2017 23:00:00
3           EventA      07/19/2017 21:00:00
2           EventA      07/18/2017 21:00:00
1           EventB      07/18/2017 21:00:00

*EventID is randomly generated number and can not be used for ordering

...
Tasks
1. write an SQL query to fetch a list of all unique events and latest Time when it happed 
2. write a Java code to do the same + unit tests.
	Don't need to write database read, can be a simple hardcoded population of java collection
	Use mock object for unit test.


So, the result will be 
EventA 07/19/2017 23:00:00
EventB 07/19/2017 23:00:00

If you have any doubt/question and make any assumption, pl. list down the assumption.
